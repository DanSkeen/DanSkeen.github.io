      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>EcoCAR Mobility Challenge, ERAU 2022 - present</h3>
          <p>Collaborated with large cross-campus teams to integrate connected and automated vehicle technology into a General Motors vehicle, with a focus on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems. Developed a simulation environment in Java representing a moving vehicle responding to SPaT and MAP data from our connected radios. Conducted testing, debugging and scenario possibilities using MATLAB and RoadRunner programs. Developed updates to meet project requirements while keeping the architecture flexible enough to integrate with other teams' designs. Employed agile methodologies to ensure efficient project management.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Automatic Water Tank Simulation and Monitoring System, ERAU 2022</h3>
          <p>Designed and developed a functioning automatic water tank simulation and monitoring system using real-time embedded systems using VxWorks. Worked with a team using Agile techniques to design the software architecture, write code in C/C++ using pair programming, and conduct extensive testing to ensure safe and reliable operation of the system as defined by customer requirements.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Secure Laundry Application, ERAU 2019</h3>
          <p>Led a team of five as Scrum Master to design an iOS application to be implemented in Swift. The application enabled students to securely scan their ID to keep track of dorm laundry machine usage. Developed system design documents, system requirements specifications, and test plans, emphasizing adaptability and data privacy. Received positive feedback and development was continued by the following team to eventually integrate the system on campus.</p>
